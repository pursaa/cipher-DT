		so this is what I would do.

		<script>
			//first we make the prompt and store it in a variable

			var str = window.prompt('add your sentence');

			//then we check if that works
			//so far it works but lets check that it stored the variable by console.log

			console.log(str);

			//if you saw I inspected the page and looked in the console tab and it worked!

			//next we find the first letter and last letter to uppercase
			//lets first test that we can do this before making a function

			var first = str.charAt(0).toUpperCase();

			//now we console.log it

			//it worked because we can see the R
			//now to get the last letter

			var last = str.charAt(str.length -1).toUpperCase();

			// to get the last of anything you just find the length -1 for example "apple"

			// var apple = 'apple';
			// console.log(apple.length);
			// console.log(apple.length -1);

			//it returns a number we can use that to get the position of the letter
			// console.log(apple.charAt(apple.length -1));

			//see it returned "e" from apple

			//anyways lets get back to the lesson lets console.log the variable last
			// console.log(last);

			//it worked it got the last letter and capitalized it E

			//ok now we can write our function

			//str would be the parameter that you get from the prompt
			var makeUpper = function(str){
				//get first letter 
				var first = str.charAt(0).toUpperCase();
				//get last letter
				var last = str.charAt(str.length -1).toUpperCase();
				//put them togeter
				var newStr = first + last;
				//return the results
				return newStr;
			};

			//lets test this by calling the function

			var newStr = makeUpper(str);


			//sorry I forgot to put the function in a variable and then console.log it

			// console.log(newStr);

			//see it worked it consoled RE

			//does this make sense what I'm doing? I'm making small tests as we go making sure it works by console.log

			//ok next we take our results and reverse it
			//how do we do that?
			//I guess we could just move the position around

			// var reverseStr = newStr.charAt(newStr.length -1) + newStr.charAt(0);
			// console.log(reverseStr);

			//it worked so lets make that function

			var makeBackwards = function(newStr){
				//change the order of the letters
				var reverseStr = newStr.charAt(newStr.length -1) + newStr.charAt(0);
				//return the results
				return reverseStr;
			};

			//ok lets test this function

			// var test = makeBackwards(newStr);
			// console.log(test);

			//did you see that error message?
			//it told me reversStr is not defined. Thats usually a clue where to look if your code isn't working. check the console. I miss spelled reverseStr;

			//so it worked!
			//whats next
			//ok now we just create a new function that calls the ones we made

			var callTheFunctions = function(str){
				//call the first function
				//the first function take the parameter as its argument
				var first = makeUpper(str);

				//call the second function
				//the second function will take the results from the first function that is stored in a variable "first"
				var second = makeBackwards(first);

				//add second to the end of the str
				var newStr = str + second;

				// console.log(newStr);

				//return the results
				return newStr;
			};

			var letters = callTheFunctions(str);
			console.log('this is letters');
			console.log(letters);

			//ok lets test it!!!
			// callTheFunctions(str);

			//oops forgot to console.log it
			//ok it worked
			//next we add to our function by adding the results to the end of the original sentence

			//I actually don't remember this method so I'll look it up
			//I found he concat() method but thinking about it I could just add it together

			//yay it worked!
			//did you see that!

			//ok lets break this last function into pieces
			//step 1 get the original str length and divide by 2

			//it outputted 6.5 but is that correct?
			//lets check

			// var count = str.length;
			// console.log('this is the length of the string')
			// console.log(count);

			// count = count/2;
			// console.log('this is the length divided by 2');
			// console.log(count);

			//looks correct to me
			//ok now we need to round down
			//I don't remember that so lets look that up
			//I found the .floor() method that rounds down
			//lets try that

			// console.log('this is rounded down');
			// count = Math.floor(count);


			//I just made a test to see what letter that would be
			//so str.charAt(count) returns "i";
			// console.log(str.charAt(count));


			//looks like I screwed up
			//lets take a closer look at that method
			//ok I did that wrong
			//looks like I have to add the number as a arguement
			//forgot to console it again

			//ok it rounded down to 6 perfect!
			//lets make that function
			//ok we need to select the letter at the position of 6

			//ok the last step is easy just put the letter at the beginning

			var roundDown = function(str1, str2){
				var count = str.length;
				count = count/2;
				count = Math.floor(count);
				var letter = str.charAt(count);
				var newStr = letter + str2;

				console.log(newStr);
				//return the results
				return newStr;
			};

			//lets test this by call this function
			var finalStr = roundDown(str, letters);

			//well that didn't work
			//what happened?
			//nevermind I'm stupid
			//we should just store the 3rd function in a variable then pass it to the 4th

			//lets that instead
			//damn it that didn't work!

			//ok I got it to work
			//did you see what I did
			//I console.log my variables to make sure what was working and what was not working

			//so it turns out in the roundDown function I needed 2 arguements 
			//I needed the original text in the variable str
			// and I need the modified text with the capital letters at the end stored in the variable letters

			//the reason I couldn't see it in the console was because I was tring to console.log newstr instead of newStr

			//yay we did it


			//the bonus does requre making it to an array because doing it the other way is a long way to do it

			//this is how I would do it
			//first store the results from the 4th function in a variable

			//make it into a variable
			finalStr = finalStr.split('');

			//next use the reverse() for arrays

			finalStr = finalStr.reverse();

			//last turn the array back into a string
			//I don't remember what that is so lets look it up
			//I found the join() and toString() method
			//I'm sure they both work but I'm going to use the .join()

			finalStr = finalStr.join('');
			console.log(finalStr);
